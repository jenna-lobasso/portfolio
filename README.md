# <> Web Development Portfolio </>

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!

This site showcases my web development projects, highlights my skills, and shares a bit about my background and career journey.



## About Me ヾ(＾∇＾) 

I graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science, concentrating in Geochemistry, where my research focused on geothermal energy. From there, I pursued a Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which ultimately led me into a more civic data and public transparency role.

It was in that role that I started developing websites, and I quickly realized how much I enjoyed the process. While I’m not formally trained in web design or development, I’ve found it to be both challenging and rewarding! So much so that I’m excited to see myself growing into a future development role.

This portfolio is my space to experiment, build, and share that journey! 



## What’s Inside (〜^∇^ )〜 

This portfolio is designed to be a central hub where I can bring together the different pieces of my work and background. Inside, you’ll find a collection of projects I’ve built, each with descriptions and links that show the kind of web development I’ve been exploring. There’s also an “About Me” section that shares more about my academic and professional journey, from environmental science and GIS to data visualization and web development!
