# 🌐 Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!

This site showcases my web development projects, highlights my skills, and shares a bit about my background and career journey.



## 👋 About Me

I graduated with a **B.S. in Environmental Science** (concentration in Geochemistry) where my research focused on **geothermal energy**. From there, I pursued a **Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, which ultimately led me into a more **policy-focused position**.

It was in that role that I started **developing websites**, and I quickly realized how much I enjoyed the process. While I’m not formally trained in web design or development, I’ve found it to be both challenging and rewarding — so much so that I’m excited to see myself growing into a **future development role**.

This portfolio is my space to **experiment, build, and share** that journey.
